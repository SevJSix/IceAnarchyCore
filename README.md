# IceAnarchyCore - Bukkit & NMS Plugin
IceAnarchyCore is a Bukkit & NMS plugin specifically designed for anarchy servers such as iceanarchy.org on Minecraft version 1.12.2. This plugin uses high level programming techniques and has been developed to be as memory safe, efficient, and low level as possible.

The project was started by SevJ6 (me) after a long break from running anarchy servers. The goal was to create a plugin that would enhance the player experience while maintaining server stability and performance. IceAnarchyCore has been designed to work seamlessly and aims to provide a range of features to enhance the anarchy experience.
